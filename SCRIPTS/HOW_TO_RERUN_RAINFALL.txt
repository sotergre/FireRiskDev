1) Get ones day of TRMM rainfall data from FTP
2) run rainfall sums for 24 hour duration, period 1 and period 2
3) scales binaries to 8bit, converts to png and applys color table

HOW to RUN:

1) Open /FIRERISK/SCRIPTS/TRMM3B42RT_day_GMTminus5.sh

2) set input parameters. Previous year and month refer to the day and month of the previous day.  See the following example.
prevyear=2008
prevmonth="07"
prevday="06"
prevjday=188

curryear=2008
currmonth="07"
currday="07"

3) The last few lines give the option to enter into the database.  This is commented out since the rainfall binaries and pngs have already been entered into the data base.  
If the data was never downloaded or generated then uncomment the last line #saveimagedb.pl -p "/FIRERISK/DATA/AMZ/3B42RT/${prevyear}/dslr/ppt_3b42rt_${prevyear}$(printf "%.3d" $prevjday)_dslr_AMZ.bin" -t 0 -f 1 -r 0 -j "${prevyear}$(printf "%.3d" $prevjday)"

NEXT STEP is to rerun the days since last rain fall from that day forward 
/FIRERISK/SCRIPTS/days_since_last_rain.sh
change line 5:  year=2008
change line 6: "prevyear=$year" if first day is January 1st
change jdays in loop to start with problem day and run to present days
for (( day = 255; day <= 262; day++ ))
Make sure if previous year is a leap year to change body so that prevday is set to 366

THEN RERUN firerisk for same days:
/FIRERISK/SCRIPTS/AMZ_littermoisture_day.sh

edit options
#### Shell Options #####
year=2006
beginjday=1
endjday=365
prevyear=2005
prevday=365
